## Introduction

The places we live have an enormous effect on our everyday life, from the length of our commute to the types of food we are able to buy and the resources we are able to access. In public health, these factors are referred to as social determinants of health. In this project, I examined relationships between social determinants of health (SDOH) and relationships between neighborhoods and boros in New York City. 

**Note: There are 5 boros in New York City (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island) and many neighborhoods contained within each boro.** 

Throughout this project I will explore two aims:
1. Aim 1: Examine social determinants of health by neighborhood and poverty levels.
2. Aim 2: Examine accessibility factors in relation to percent disabled in a neighborhood.

## Dataset

The dataset I examined for this project was created by a PhD student working on a statistical analysis to understand extrinsic factors that influence the price of rent. (Full dataset available vai Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ted8080/nyc-housing-dataset-extrinsic-factors). In this project, I will explore these variables from a social determinants of health perspective.

The original dataset has 36 variables. Here is a sample of this data:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', error = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
source("clean_data.R")
library(knitr)
kable(head(housing[,c(1,2,5,6,10)]),
      col.names = c("Neighborhood", "Boro", "% w/ Car-Free Commute", "% Disabled", "Median Income ($)"),
      caption = "Sample of NYC Housing Data")
```

## Results

#### Aim 1: Examine social determinants of health by neighborhood and poverty levels

First, I examined a few social determinants of health in relation to poverty levels. The variables I examined included:

* *Public Housing (properties/units)*: Total number of public housing properties/units in properties (includes housing owned and operated by NYCHA even if the properties were not originally public housing).
* *Residential Units within ¼ Mile of a Park*: The percentage of residential units that are within a ¼ mile of a park.
* *Median Household Income*: The total income of all members of a household aged 15 years or older. Includes both homeowner households and renter households.
* *Median Rent (all renters, recent movers, studios and one-bedrooms, two- and three- bedrooms)*: The median gross rent which includes the amount agreed to or specified in the lease regardless of whether furnishings, utilities, or services are included; and estimated monthly electricity and heating fuel costs paid by the renter.
* *Population Density (1,000 persons per square mile)*: The geographic area’s population divided by its land area.
* *Car-Free Commute (% of commuters)*: The percentage of workers who commute primarily by foot, bicycle, or public transportation, as a share of all workers over the age of 16 who do not work at home.
* *Mean Travel Time to Work (minutes)*: The mean commute time in minutes for commuters residing in the geographic area.
* *Residential Units within ½ Mile of a Subway/Rail Entrance*: The percentage of residential units that are within a ½ mile walk of a station entrance for the New York City Subway, Long Island Rail Road, PATH, Amtrak, Metro-North Railroad, or Staten Island Railway.

In the figure below, each variable is plotted against poverty rate. Income is represented by dot color, where darker blues represent lower median income and lighter blue is higher median income. Income can serve as a "quality check" on data since it should roughly track with y-axis poverty rates. 

![Social Determinants of Health Exploratory Plot](figures/sdoh_exploratory.png)
As expected, income (shade of blue) roughly follows poverty rate. From these plots, it seems like there might an interesting association between poverty rate and access to a subways and parks, while the other variables may not yield an interesting insights.

In addition to this exploratory plot, I will also conduct a principal component analysis in order to see if neighborhoods might share similarities with their boros. 

![Principal Component Analysis of Social Determinants of Health (Grouped by Boro)](figures/sdoh_pca.png)
From this PCA plot, we can see that Manhattan seems to have the most different set of SDOH's, whereas factors in Brooklyn and Bronx are a bit more similar. Queens and Staten Island also seem to face similar factors. 

Let's remove poverty from the PCA and use that as the groups instead of boro. 

I will group neighborhoods into three groups: those in the bottom 25% for poorest neighborhoods, top 25% wealthiest, and middle 50%.

From this plot, we can see that neighborhoods tend to cluster with other neighborhoods that share similar poverty rates. 

### Aim 2: Do neighborhoods with higher rates of people with disabilities have less access to mobility? 

Next, I examined some general factors that could affect how well people with disabilities can access healthcare, work opportunities, and move around the city more generally. The variables that I included in this section and justification for inclusion are:

* *Disabled Population*: The percentage of the adult population who have disabilities that impair hearing, vision, ambulation, cognition, self-care, or independent living. **This will be compared to the other factors below.**
* *Car-Free Commute (% of commuters)*: The percentage of workers who commute primarily by foot, bicycle, or public transportation, as a share of all workers over the age of 16 who do not work at home. **Many disabled people might have difficulty operating a vehicle, so use of public transport would be critical for mobility and ability to access services around the city**
* *Mean Travel Time to Work (minutes)*: The mean commute time in minutes for commuters residing in the geographic area. **Longer travel times could pose additional barriers to getting to work for people with disabilities**
* *Residential Units within ¼ Mile of a Park*: The percentage of residential units that are within a ¼ mile of a park. **Lower access to parks could affect quality of life, ability to exercise, and mental health for people with disabilties.**
* *Residential Units within ½ Mile of a Subway/Rail Entrance*: The percentage of residential units that are within a ½ mile walk of a station entrance for the New York City Subway, Long Island Rail Road, PATH, Amtrak, Metro-North Railroad, or Staten Island Railway. **Longer walk times could make it difficult for people with disabilities to reach the subway station, especially if they are reliant on a wheelchair, walkers, or other devices to assist with mobility.**

![Factors affecting access to services and disability ](figures/access_factors.png)
These plots suggest that places with more disabled populations don't necessarily have better access to transportation or parks. There seems to be a slight positive association showing that neighborhoods with higher proportions of people with disabilities have longer travel times to work.

Next, I used principal component analysis to see if these factors related to disabilities and access show groupings based on boro.

Now, similar to the poverty PCA analysis from Aim 2, I removed disabled population from the PCA and use that as the groups instead of boro. I added a new variable for neighborhoods that are in the top quartile for highest proportion of people with disabilities.

## Conclusion



## Future Directions
In future research, I plan to study how various social determinants of health may related to the COVID-19 case counts, deaths, or hopsitalizations observed in that neighborhood. I will also attempt to map these data points to a map of New York City neighborhoods.
